Welcome to My Coding Journey Repository! 🚀
Hey there! I'm a student at 1337 coding school in Morocco, currently exploring the fundamentals of C programming in my first year. This repository is a collection of projects, exercises, and experiments as I delve into the world of coding. Additionally, I'm passionate about web development and excited to blend C knowledge with web technologies. 💻✨

Projects 📁
C Programming Exercises: This section contains various exercises and mini-projects written in C. Each folder is dedicated to a specific concept or exercise.

Web Development Exploration: As I progress in my learning journey, I'll be incorporating web development projects and experiments, combining my C programming skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
